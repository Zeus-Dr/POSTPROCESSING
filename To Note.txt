This revised code uses the Graphics.DrawImage method for resizing, 
It employs high-quality interpolation. 
It avoids direct manipulation of pixel data and simplifies the process. 
Additionally, it ensures proper disposal of image objects to manage resources efficiently.

//Denoising
Applying Median Filter ()
Applying Gaussian Filter (Adjust the kernelSize and sigma parameters to control the blurring effect)

WhiteBalance
Working directly with image bytes using LockBits and pointers can 
significantly boost performance as it avoids the overhead of the GetPixel 
and SetPixel methods.
